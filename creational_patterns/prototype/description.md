# PROTOTYPE

* A partially or fully initialized object that you copy (clone) and make use of, that is, you customize
the new copies of it.
* Complicated objects (e.g., cars) aren't designed from scratch. Usually, one reiterate over existing designs.
* An existing (partially or fully constructed) design is a Prototype.
* We make a copy (clone) of the prototype and customize it.
  * Requires *deep copy*.
  * This cloning is convenient, that is, in a nice way, through an API (e.g., a Factory).
