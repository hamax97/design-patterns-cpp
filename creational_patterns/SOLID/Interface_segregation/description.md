# INTERFACE SEGREGATION PRINCIPLE

* Creational pattern.
* Avoid stuffing too much into a single interface. Instead if it makes sense, break your interface into separate interfaces, or at least make your interface smaller.
* Consists in implementing interfaces that are not too long, so that the implementers don't have to implement too much.
