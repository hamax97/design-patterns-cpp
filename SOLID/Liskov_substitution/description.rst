LISKOV SUBSTITUTION PRINCIPLE
=============================

* Creational pattern.
* Objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes withouto altering the correctness of the program.
* If you have a function that receives a base class, any *derived* class should be able to be substituted in the function without any problem.
* The example compiles but the expected behavior is not ok.
