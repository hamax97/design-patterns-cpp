# Design Principles using C++ 11,14,17

Description and examples of many of the design principles using the C++ programming language. The design principles presented here are:

* SOLID design principles.
* Creational design principles.
* Structural design principles.
* Behavioral design principles.

Even though there are only three types of them here, they are classified in:

## Creational patterns.
These patterns are all about class instantiation. They are sub-divided into:
* Class-creational patterns: Use inheritance effectively in the instantiation process.
* Object-creational patterns: Use delegation effectively in the instantiation process.

## Structural patterns.
These patterns are all about class and object composition. Structural class-creation patterns use inheritance to compose interfaces. Structural object-patterns define ways to compose objects to obtain new functionality.

## Behavioral patterns.
Patterns that are most specifically concerned about object communication.

## Concurrency patterns.
## Data Access patterns.
## Enterprise patterns.
## Real-Time patterns.
