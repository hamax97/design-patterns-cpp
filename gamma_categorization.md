# GAMMA CATEGORIZATION
Design Patterns are typically split into three categories.

* Creational Patterns
  + Deal with the creation (construction) of objects.
  + Explicit (constructor) vs implicit (Dependency Injection, Reflection, etc.)
  + Wholesale initialization (single statement) vs piecewise initalization (step-by-step).

* Structural Patterns
  + Concerned with the structure (e.g, class members).
  + Many patterns are wrappers that mimic the undlerlying class' interface.
  + Stress the importance of good API design.

* Behavioral Patterns
  + They are all different; no central theme.
  + Commonly referred to object communication.
